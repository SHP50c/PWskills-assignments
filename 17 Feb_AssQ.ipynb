    "2.State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "ans:Schema-less Database: It is the great feature provided by the MongoDB. A Schema-less database means one collection can\n",
    "    hold different types of documents in it. Or in other words, in the MongoDB database, a single collection can hold\n",
    "    multiple documents and these documents may consist of the different numbers of fields, content, and size. It is not\n",
    "    necessary that the one document is similar to another document like in the relational databases. Due to this cool\n",
    "    feature, MongoDB provides great flexibility to databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Document Oriented: In MongoDB, all the data stored in the documents instead of tables like in RDBMS. In these\n",
    "    documents, the data is stored in fields(key-value pair) instead of rows and columns which make the data much more\n",
    "    flexible in comparison to RDBMS. And each document contains its unique object id.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Indexing: In MongoDB database, every field in the documents is indexed with primary and secondary indices this makes\n",
    "    easier and takes less time to get or search data from the pool of the data. If the data is not indexed, then database\n",
    "    search each document with the specified query which takes lots of time and not so efficient.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Scalability: MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of sharding. Sharding means to distribute data on\n",
    "    multiple servers, here a large amount of data is partitioned into data chunks using the shard key, and these data\n",
    "    chunks are evenly distributed across shards that reside across many physical servers. It will also add new machines to\n",
    "    a running database.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Replication: MongoDB provides high availability and redundancy with the help of replication, it creates multiple copies\n",
    "    of the data and sends these copies to a different server so that if one server fails, then the data is retrieved from\n",
    "    another server.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Aggregation: It allows to perform operations on the grouped data and get a single result or computed result. It is\n",
    "    similar to the SQL GROUPBY clause. It provides three different aggregations i.e, aggregation pipeline, map-reduce\n",
    "    function, and single-purpose aggregation methods\n",
    "    \n",
    "    High Performance: The performance of MongoDB is very high and data persistence as compared to another database due to\n",
    "    its features like scalability, indexing, replication, etc."
