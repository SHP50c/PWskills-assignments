    "   i]Third-Party Modules:\n",
    "     Python Package Index (PyPI) comprises a multitude of third-party modules which makes Python integrate with other \n",
    "     languages and platforms easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ii]Presence of Libraries:\n",
    "     Python is fraught with numerous standard libraries that include string operations, internet protocols, web service\n",
    "     tools, Machine Learning libraries, and operating System Interfaces. The presence of these libraries essentially helps\n",
    "     in reducing the code to be written by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    " iii]Open Source and free:\n",
    "     Python is free for use even for commercial purposes. Moreover, active\n",
    "     developers can contribute by developing modules and appending them to the existing library.\n",
    "     \n",
    "  iv]Huge Support Community\n",
    "     Due to lack of official technical support for Python is open-sourced has prompted the development of communities that      enrich the resource bank for continued development and adoption of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "   v]Easy to learn\n",
    "     Python is popular for its excellent readability. This means, even a non-programmer can read and comprehend the\n",
    "     uncluttered syntax. The PEP 8 guidelines provide a set of rules to help in formatting the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  vi]User-Friendly data structures\n",
    "     With its built-in data structures, Python can easily construct run-time data structures including Arrays, Lists,\n",
    "     tuples, and Files.  \n",
    "\n",
    " vii]Speed\n",
    "     Being expressive and with object-oriented design, Python contributes to increased speed and productivity even with\n",
    "     less amount of coding. Python is considered ideal for developing complex, multi-protocol network applications."
